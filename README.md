Python/Arduino Code for Multiplexed Lightbox


This repository contains all files necessary for building a lightbox with 96 multiplexed LEDS. TO use any Python/Arduino scripts, ensure that the COM ports and fluorescence data file paths are changed to your specific setup.

-STL Files are available for 3D printing a shell to contain all electronic components on the lightbox.

-Lightbox schematic shows the circuit diagram in which all components should be wired. 

-Python Files are used for fluorescence data analysis and sending data to the lightbox for lighting.

-Arduino .ino files are uploaded to the Ardruino module used in the lightbox for PC communicationa and LED multiplexing.

-Lightbox PCB Files zip folder contain all output files for third-party manufacturers.
